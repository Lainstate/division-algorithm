# Divide Until Sum Equals Original

This Go program takes a floating-point number as input and performs iterative halving of the number until the sum of the divisions equals the original number, accounting for floating-point precision limitations.

## Features
- The program divides a given number by two repeatedly, and the sum of the divisions is checked against the original number.
- The process stops when dividing further would result in an insignificant change (due to floating-point precision).
- Outputs each division step and ensures the final sum matches the original number with a precision tolerance.

## How It Works
The program divides the input number by 2 in each step. The sum of these divisions is compared with the original number, and the division continues until the remaining value is too small to make a significant difference. A small precision threshold (`epsilon`) is used to handle floating-point inaccuracies and to stop the loop when necessary.

### Key Points:
1. **Float Precision Handling**: Floating-point numbers are limited in how accurately they can represent decimal values. The program uses a precision tolerance (`epsilon = 1e-12`) to prevent infinite division loops caused by very small values.
2. **Termination Condition**: Division stops when the next division would result in an insignificant change (i.e., when the number being divided is smaller than `epsilon`).
3. **Detailed Output**: The program prints each step of the division process and checks if the final sum matches the original number, allowing small floating-point deviations.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.13 or later

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository or copy the source code to a local directory.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.go` file.
3. Run the program with the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
4. Enter a floating-point number when prompted:
   ```bash
   Enter a number (can be decimal): 1.618
5. The program will output the series of divisions, the sum of the divisions, and the original number:
    ```bash
    Divisions:
    Step 1: 0.809000000000
    Step 2: 0.404500000000
    Step 3: 0.202250000000
    ...

    Sum of divisions: 1.618000000000
    Original number: 1.618000000000
    The sum of divisions equals the original number.

## Example
For the input 1.618, the output would look like this:
```bash
Enter a number (can be decimal): 1.618
Divisions:
Step 1: 0.809000000000
Step 2: 0.404500000000
Step 3: 0.202250000000
...
Step 38: 0.000000000006
Step 39: 0.000000000003
Step 40: 0.000000000001
Step 41: 0.000000000001

Sum of divisions: 1.618000000000
Original number: 1.618000000000
The sum of divisions equals the original number.
